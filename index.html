		<h1>Hi, Chichie ♡</h1>
		<p>     I just wanted to let you know that I appreciate you and everything you do always. ⸜(｡˃ ᵕ ˂ )⸝♡  
			You have no idea how you've changed my life. I never thought it was possible to have this much love for someone, I never thought my heart could handle it.
			Alam ko na may mga araw at darating na araw na nag-aaway tayo at hindi nagkakaintindihan, but you’re the only person I’d want to argue with. I truly love you.
			Kapag kasama kita, I feel different, but in a good way. Lagi akong natawa at nakangiti, and I don’t have to pretend na everything is okay.
			With you, I can just drop the facade and express everything nang totoo. With you I feel safe and loved. Ang dali mong kausap, ang dali mong lapitan.
			And everything you say resonates with me like no one else’s words ever did. You’ve shown me na may isang tao pala sa mundo who can love me for who I am.
			Thank you for being here because, with you, I’m different. With you, I’m happy. I love and miss you so much, chie! ♡</p>

		<h1>Love,  Your dragon baby ♡ </h1>
